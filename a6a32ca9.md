# Haskell Notes

### Curried functional

Functional to make a blue to create a make and break functional.
Function of multiple argument that can be applied to their argument one at a time are called curried function

### Read
`lines :: String -> [String]`
Lines has a type Strings to list-of-string

### Haskell Performance
common gotchas (lazy folds, WHNF, etc.)

### Load Module in GHCI
```hs
> :module + Data.Ratio
> :m + Data.Ratio
> :set +t
> :unset +t
```
+t print type of expression after the expression
```
ghci> 's'
's'
it :: Char -- x :: y -> the expression x(it) has a type y(char)
```
- `it` is special variable in which ghci stores the result of the last expression we evaluated
- you can use it variable in next expression
- If `:set +t` is off
> :type 'a'
> :type it

# List
- about
List -> [1, 2, 3]
[1..10]
.. => denotes a enumeration. use for types whose elements can be enumerated

- Progression in List
ghci> [1.0,1.25..2.0]
[1.0,1.25,1.5,1.75,2.0]
ghci> [1,4..15]
[1,4,7,10,13]
ghci> [10,9..1]
[10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]

- Infinte enumeration
[1..]
## Operator on List
- `++`
[3,1,3] ++ [3,7]
- `:` cons (short for constructor) add an element at front
ghci> 1 : [2,3]
[1,2,3]
ghci> 1 : []
[1]
# Strings
string are list of char
ghci> let a = ['l', 'o', 't', 's', ' ', 'o', 'f', ' ', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'k']
ghci> a
"lots of work"
ghci> a == "lots of work"
True
- empty string "" == [] empty list 

## Rational Number
11%29

# Coversion
Coversion is also known as casting or conversion.
We must explicitly coverse types by applying coversion function

# Type inference
Haskell Compiler can automatically deduce types of almost all expressions in a program
